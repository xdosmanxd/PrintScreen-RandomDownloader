# PrintScreen-RandomDownloader
The program makes all the possible combinations with 2 letters and 4 numbers, adds them to a list and shuffles it. Then it starts to download those images from prntscr.com. Usage is you run the main.py for any time you want and after you stopped it run the cleanup.py to remove the empty image files.
